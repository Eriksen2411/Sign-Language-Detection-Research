# Sign Language Detection Research

This is a Sign Language Detection Project done in module CS3244 Machine Learning National University of Singapore.

This project included 4 common classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bayes Classifier, Neural Netorks (Both Convolutional Neural Network and Artificial Neural Network). The project also introduced a new approach of using MediaPipe to generate dataset of hand landmarks, this approach helps improve performance when the quality of image is not very good (lighting and hand positioning).
